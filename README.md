# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

This Terraform Bootcamp implements the Infrastructure as Code concept by using Terraform to create a simple Content Management System--TERRAHOUSE to author my personal website and connect it to TERRATOWNS--a community website that acts as a hub to discover and connect terraformers to each other self-hosted websites.
